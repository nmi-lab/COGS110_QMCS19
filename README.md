## Course Overview: 
Cognitive scientists try to understand how the mind works, especially
those of humans. To this end, they create descriptions of cognitive processes to make predictions
for behavior and ultimately explain it. Computational modeling is becoming important in this
endeavor because it leads to precise quantifiable predictions. Such predictions cannot be obtained
with verbal descriptions alone. However, modeling requires some degree of rigor in the form of
mathematics and computer programming. Such skills are not always common among cognitive
science students.
The objective of this class is to improve students familiarity of the required
methods for modeling and data analysis in cognitive Sciences by consolidating on
mathematical skills, namely probability theory, parameter estimation and linear
algebra.
Through the assignments and discussion, this course will illustrate tools for parameter es-
timation, modeling, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction techniques on real-world
data such as behavioral data, face images and text messages. The skills acquired in this course
will prepare students for advanced courses and labs such as Bayesian Cognitive Modeling, Cog-
nitive Robotics and Brain-inspired Learning Machines offered by the Department of Cognitive
Sciences.
Classes will be lecture-based and exercise-based with hands-on experimentation using Python.
The course is introductory and intended to be accessible to students from a broad range of disci-
plines, with varying background knowledge in the field. However, quantitative reasoning skills,
including basic calculus and basic familiarity with a programming language such as MATLAB
or Python are expected.

## Grading: 
Reports and assignments must be submitted before the deadline posted with each
assignment sheet. Letter grades will be assigned on the basis of assignments (40%), midterm
(20%) and final (40%). Assignments returned late will count as half a homework. No make-up
examinations.

## Academic Misconduct: 
Students found to be guilty of plagiarism or cheating as defined by
official university policy will automatically receive an “F” in the course. Other actions consistent
with university policy may also be taken where deemed appropriate. Important information
